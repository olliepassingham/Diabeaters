🔧 REPLIT AGENT PROMPT — ADD TRAVEL MODE SECTION
CONTEXT

You are continuing development of the Diabeater app.

⚠️ Issue to fix:
Travel Mode was not created in the app.
This is a required core feature and must now be implemented properly.

Your task is to design and build a dedicated Travel Mode section, fully integrated into the app’s navigation, AI logic layer, and dashboard access.

🎯 OBJECTIVE

Create a Travel Mode feature that helps people with diabetes prepare for travel proactively, reduce risk, and avoid supply-related or access-related emergencies.

This is not medical advice and must be labelled accordingly.

🧭 FEATURE PLACEMENT & ACCESS (MANDATORY)

Travel Mode must be accessible via all of the following:

Main Dashboard

As a Quick Action button: “Travel Mode”

Scenario Adviser Section

As a dedicated sub-section:

Sick Day Mode

Travel Mode

Settings (optional shortcut)

For reviewing past travel plans

Travel Mode must feel like a major app feature, not hidden.

🧩 TRAVEL MODE — STRUCTURE
1. Travel Mode Entry Screen

Explain clearly (calm tone):

“Travel Mode helps you plan supplies and prepare for unexpected issues while travelling.
This feature does not provide medical advice.”

Button:

Start Travel Plan

2. Travel Mode Inputs (Required)

User must input:

Travel duration

Number of days

Destination

Country / city

Travel type

Domestic

International

Timezone change

None

Minor (1–3 hours)

Major (4+ hours)

Access risk (optional but encouraged)

Easy access to pharmacies

Limited access

Unsure

3. AI Travel Logic (CORE)

The AI layer must:

Pull data from:

Supply Tracker

User’s insulin types

Daily usage estimates

CGM / testing habits

Calculate:

Estimated insulin needs for trip

Estimated needles / cartridges

CGM sensors / test strips

Safety buffer (extra supplies)

⚠️ Safety rules

Always include failure buffers

Never reduce recommended supplies

Always plan for delays, breakage, loss

📦 TRAVEL MODE OUTPUTS
A. Smart Packing List

Display a checklist-style list including:

Insulin (with buffer)

Delivery method supplies

CGM / test supplies

Hypo treatment supplies

Backup essentials

Each item should show:

Estimated amount

Reasoning (e.g. “extra added for delays”)

B. Emergency Preparedness Section

Provide non-medical guidance on:

What to do if insulin is lost

What to do if supplies run out

When to seek local medical help

Include:

Nearby pharmacies (if location services allowed)

General advice for international travel (documentation, backups)

C. Risk Warnings (If Applicable)

Examples:

Long travel duration

Limited pharmacy access

Timezone changes

Border crossing risks

Warnings must be:

Calm

Non-alarmist

Actionable

🧠 AI LANGUAGE & SAFETY REQUIREMENTS

All Travel Mode AI outputs must:

Use suggestion-based language

Avoid dosages or medical instructions

Be labelled clearly:

“Not medical advice”

Prioritise safety and preparedness

Reduce cognitive load

🎨 UX REQUIREMENTS

Calm, reassuring tone

Checklist-driven UI

Clear visual separation:

Inputs

Packing list

Emergency plan

Easy return to Dashboard

🧱 TECH REQUIREMENTS

Travel Mode must be:

Modular

Reusable

Extendable (future features like flight reminders)

Logic must live in the AI logic layer, not UI

Data must be user-scoped and privacy-safe

🧪 ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA (MUST PASS)

Travel Mode is considered complete only if:

It has a dedicated UI flow

It appears in Dashboard + Scenario Adviser

It generates:

Packing list

Safety buffers

Emergency plan

It clearly states “Not medical advice”

It uses existing Supply Tracker data

🚀 NEXT STEPS AFTER IMPLEMENTATION

Once Travel Mode is complete:

Confirm integration points

Identify premium gating options

Prepare for future CGM integration
