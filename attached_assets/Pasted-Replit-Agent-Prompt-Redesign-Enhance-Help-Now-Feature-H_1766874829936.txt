Replit Agent Prompt: Redesign & Enhance “Help Now” Feature (Hypoglycemia Emergency UX)
Project Context

You are working inside an existing diabetes management app (Type 1 Diabetes focused).
Your task is not to rebuild the app, but to redesign and enhance the existing “Help Now” feature so it is:

Extremely easy to use during a hypoglycemic event

Safe and effective even if the user is confused, shaking, or has blurred vision

Informative enough that an unfamiliar bystander can help correctly

This feature is mission-critical and must prioritize speed, clarity, and automatic escalation over visual complexity.

1. Purpose of “Help Now”
Primary Goal

👉 Get the user safe within seconds, not minutes.

Core Principles

The feature must:

Reduce thinking and decision-making to near zero

Escalate help automatically if the user cannot act

Work even when the user is:

Alone

Confused

Shaking

Visually impaired during a hypo

Design assumption:

“Can someone with a blood glucose of 2.5 mmol/L successfully use this?”

If the answer is no, simplify further.

2. UI / UX Requirements
Home Screen Placement

“HELP NOW” must be always visible

Large, high-contrast button

Red or emergency color

Clear label:

HELP NOW

Visual & Interaction Rules

One-tap access (no menus before action)

Very large text and icons

Minimal choices initially

High contrast (hypo-friendly)

Haptic feedback when pressed

No fine motor precision required

3. Behavior When “Help Now” Is Pressed
Step 1: Immediate Automatic Status Check

Immediately and silently perform:

Check CGM data (if connected)

Check last logged glucose value

Check heart rate (if wearable connected)

Start a 30–60 second countdown

On-screen message (large text):

“We’re checking your levels. Help is standing by.”

No user input required.

Step 2: Smart Emergency Actions (Big Buttons Only)

Show 3–4 very large buttons, never a menu.

🧃 Treat a Low

When selected:

Display:

“You may be low”

Exact grams of carbs needed

Visual guidance:

“Drink juice”

“Eat glucose tablets”

Start a 15-minute timer

Automatically re-check CGM when timer ends

📞 Call Emergency Contact

One tap should:

Immediately call the primary emergency contact

Auto-send SMS:

“I need help. My blood sugar may be low. Please check on me.”

Include automatically:

Live location

Live glucose reading (if enabled)

No confirmation loops.

🚑 Call Emergency Services

Immediate call to emergency services

Automatically share:

Live location

Message:
“Type 1 Diabetes – possible hypoglycemia”

Option (pre-configured) to auto-trigger if user becomes unresponsive

🗣️ Speak Instructions Aloud

Critical for severe hypos.

The app should read instructions out loud, such as:

“You are low. Drink juice now. Sit down. Help is coming.”

This must work when:

Vision is blurred

User cannot read

Screen interaction is difficult

4. Automatic Escalation Logic (Critical Feature)

If any of the following occur:

User does not respond

Glucose does not improve after treatment

CGM shows continued drop

Countdown expires with no interaction

Then the app must automatically:

Notify emergency contact

Share live location + glucose

Call emergency services (if user enabled this setting)

This makes the app proactive, not reactive.

5. Extra Safety Layers (Optional but Strongly Recommended)
🔒 Lock-Screen Access

“HELP NOW” usable without unlocking the phone

🧠 Hypo Detection Mode

If glucose drops rapidly:

“We think you may be low. Do you need help?”

Auto-opens Help Now if no response

🏟️ Public Place / Bystander Mode

Display a clear screen with:

“I have Type 1 Diabetes”

Simple instructions for bystanders

QR code linking to emergency info

6. Personalization (Configured Once, Never During Emergency)

Allow users to pre-configure (outside emergencies):

Emergency contacts

When emergency services are auto-called

Preferred hypo treatment

Spoken vs silent mode

Location-based profiles (home, work, stadium, etc.)

⚠️ No settings changes allowed during an active emergency flow.

Technical & Design Constraints

Prioritize accessibility over aesthetics

Fail-safe defaults (escalate rather than wait)

Clear state handling for:

Connected vs disconnected CGM

Offline mode

No wearable available

Code should be modular so this feature can evolve independently

Output Expectations

Update UI components related to “Help Now”

Implement logic for automatic checks and escalation

Ensure feature works even with partial data

Comment code clearly, especially around safety logic
