🩺 Project Name

Diabeaters

💡 Project Description

Diabeaters is a companion app for Type 1 diabetics designed to simplify daily decision-making and management.
It has two main modules:

Supply Tracker — helps users monitor their prescription supplies (needles, insulin types, CGMs). Based on daily usage inputs, the app estimates remaining quantities and notifies users when supplies are low.

AI Activity Advisor — assists users with insulin and carbohydrate adjustments. Users input their mealtime carb ratio and planned activities; the AI recommends ratio adjustments or pre-activity carbohydrate portions (CP).

The app aims to reduce cognitive load and promote safer, data-driven diabetes self-management.

🧩 Target Platform

Web Application (mobile-responsive).

🌐 Operating Environment
