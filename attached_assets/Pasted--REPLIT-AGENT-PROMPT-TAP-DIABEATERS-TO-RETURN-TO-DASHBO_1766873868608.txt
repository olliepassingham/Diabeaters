🧭 REPLIT AGENT PROMPT — TAP “DIABEATERS” TO RETURN TO DASHBOARD
CONTEXT

You are continuing development of the Diabeaters app.

Users must be able to return to the Dashboard quickly and intuitively from anywhere in the app.

To reduce friction and cognitive load, the app name “Diabeaters” at the top of each page must act as a consistent navigation anchor.

🎯 OBJECTIVE

Enable users to tap the “Diabeaters” brand element in the page header to immediately return to the Dashboard.

This interaction must:

Be consistent across the entire app

Feel natural and discoverable

Never interfere with emergency access or system navigation

📍 REQUIRED BEHAVIOUR (MANDATORY)
Global Header Interaction

On every non-dashboard screen:

The app header must display:

The text “Diabeaters”

Accompanied by the brand face outline (if present per design system)

When the user taps “Diabeaters”:

The app must navigate directly to the Dashboard (Home)

Navigation must:

Reset the stack (no deep back navigation required)

Preserve dashboard widget state and layout

🚫 EXCLUSIONS & SAFETY RULES

On the Dashboard itself:

“Diabeaters” remains visible

Tap interaction may be disabled or do nothing

Help Now / Emergency Mode:

Do NOT override emergency flows

If present, the tap should prompt confirmation before exiting

🎨 UX & VISUAL REQUIREMENTS

“Diabeaters” must look:

Like a brand anchor, not a button

Subtle but clearly tappable

No underlines, button chrome, or aggressive affordances

Tap target must be:

Accessibility-compliant

Large enough for one-handed use

Optional enhancement:

Very subtle feedback on tap (e.g. opacity change)

🧱 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS

Implement as a global header component

Header must:

Accept a prop to enable/disable dashboard navigation

Use a single navigation handler

Navigation must:

Route to Dashboard consistently

Work from nested and modal screens

Avoid:

Duplicated logic

Screen-specific hacks

🧠 DESIGN INTENT (DO NOT IGNORE)

This interaction should feel:

Reassuring

Predictable

Calm

The user should always know how to “go home” without thinking.

✅ ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

This task is complete only when:

Tapping “Diabeaters” returns to Dashboard from all main screens

Navigation works reliably from deep flows (e.g. Scenario Adviser, Travel Mode)

Emergency flows are protected

Implementation is centralized and reusable
