Replit Prompt — Diabeaters Home Screen Redesign

Build a modern, production-ready mobile app home screen for a Type 1 diabetes management app called Diabeaters.

The app should feel calm, human, premium, and proactive, not clinical. Use a warm neutral background (soft beige), rounded cards, subtle shadows, and clear visual hierarchy. Design for iOS and Android.

1. Header & Status

Unified header card at the top

Text on the left:

“Good morning, Ollie”

Subtext: “Here’s your diabetes today”

On the right:

Small circular status indicator with label

Green: “Stable”

Amber: “Watch”

Red: “Action needed”

Header should immediately communicate current safety status

2. Primary Action (Hero Section)

Large elevated hero card below the header

Full-width Help Now button:

Red

Rounded pill shape

Larger height for accessibility

Subtle pulse or glow animation when risk is detected

Secondary action below or beside it:

“Customize Dashboard”

Visually quieter (outlined or muted)

3. Today at a Glance

Card titled “Today”

Status row:

Green check icon

Text: “All systems normal”

Three compact micro-stats in a horizontal row:

💉 Ratios: Stable

🧃 Supplies: 12 days

🏃 Activity: Light

Primary CTA:

Plan Today →

4. Supplies Card

Card titled “Supplies”

Main metric:

“12 days remaining”

Thin horizontal progress bar showing supply usage trend

Small helper text:

“Based on last 14 days”

Actions:

“View Supplies →”

Small cart icon for reorder

5. Quick Actions (Refined)

Do NOT include “Help Now” here

Split actions into two groups:

Primary Actions (larger buttons):

Supplies

Ratios

Sick Day

Secondary Actions (smaller icon row):

Activity

Travel

History

6. AI Insights

Card titled “AI Insight”

Example insight text:

“You’ve had 3 stable mornings in a row. Consider a slightly later breakfast bolus today.”

Footer text:

“Not medical advice · Based on your data”

Insight should feel supportive and confident, not alarmist

7. Visual & UX Guidelines

Warm, non-clinical color palette

Clear elevation hierarchy between cards

Consistent icon style and sizing

Large tap targets and readable text for hypo-safe accessibility

Subtle animations only where meaningful (status, Help Now)

Goal

Create a home screen that feels like a daily diabetes command centre — reassuring, intelligent, and proactive — suitable for a freemium health app users would trust and pay for.
