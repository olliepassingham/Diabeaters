Replit Agent Prompt: Add “Bystander Instructions” to Help Now Feature
Context

You are working inside an existing diabetes app with a critical Help Now emergency feature.
Your task is to add a new button called “Bystander Instructions” designed specifically for non-diabetic bystanders who may be helping someone experiencing a hypoglycemic episode.

This feature is educational + actionable, not diagnostic, and must prioritize clarity, safety, and simplicity.

Do not redesign Help Now entirely—extend it.

1. New Button: “Bystander Instructions”
Placement & Priority

Display this button alongside other Help Now actions

Use clear, non-alarming language:

Bystander Instructions

High contrast

Large tap target

Accessible during an active emergency

Available even if the phone is locked (if Help Now already is)

2. Purpose of Bystander Instructions
Primary Goal

👉 Help a bystander quickly understand what is happening and what to do, without requiring medical knowledge.

The content should:

Explain hypoglycemia in plain language

Distinguish between mild/moderate hypo and severe/extreme hypo

Give clear, step-by-step instructions

Explicitly state what NOT to do

Reinforce when to call emergency services

Assume the reader:

Is stressed

Has never dealt with diabetes

Has limited time

May be afraid of doing harm

3. Content Structure (Very Important)
Screen 1: What’s Happening?

Plain-language explanation, large text:

“This person has Type 1 Diabetes.
Their blood sugar may be dangerously low (hypoglycemia).
Low blood sugar can cause confusion, shaking, loss of consciousness, or seizures.”

Avoid medical jargon unless explained.

Screen 2: Signs of a Low (Hypo)

Use bullet points and icons:

Shaking or trembling

Sweating

Confusion or unusual behavior

Slurred speech

Drowsiness

Pale skin

Screen 3: What To Do — If They Are Awake

Clear, step-by-step:

Give fast sugar

Juice

Regular (non-diet) soda

Glucose tablets

Sugar or honey (if safe)

Stay with them

Do not let them walk alone

Wait 10–15 minutes

Repeat sugar if they do not improve

Screen 4: Extreme Hypo — Call Emergency Services Immediately

Clear warning state (high contrast):

⚠️ CALL EMERGENCY SERVICES NOW IF:

They are unconscious

They cannot swallow

They are having a seizure

Instructions:

Do NOT give food or drink

Do NOT put anything in their mouth

Turn them on their side

Help is on the way

If glucagon is mentioned:

Only include if the app already supports it

Keep instructions extremely simple

Screen 5: Reassurance

End with reassurance to reduce panic:

“You are doing the right thing.
Low blood sugar is treatable.
Stay with them until help arrives or they recover.”

4. UX & Accessibility Requirements

Large text

High contrast

Minimal scrolling per screen

Simple language (no abbreviations)

Optional:

Text-to-speech toggle

Auto-read mode

Design assumption:

A stranger should understand this in under 10 seconds.

5. Safety & Legal Considerations

Include a subtle disclaimer:

“This information is for emergency guidance only”

Do not present as medical diagnosis

Default to calling emergency services when unsure

6. Technical Notes

Content should be modular (easy to update medically later)

No network dependency during emergency

Works offline

Reuse existing Help Now styles and state where possible

7. Output Expectations

Add new “Bystander Instructions” button to Help Now

Implement a multi-step instructional flow

Ensure content is readable, accessible, and calm

Comment code where medical assumptions are made

Design Principle Reminder

This feature exists because:

The person who needs help may not be able to explain anything.

Clarity, empathy, and safety come before elegance.
