🎨 REPLIT AGENT PROMPT — LOGO OUTLINE INTEGRATION (Diabeater)
CONTEXT

You are continuing development of the Diabeater mobile app.

A minimalist single-line face outline logo (provided asset) must now be integrated deeply and consistently into the app’s visual identity.

This is not a background image or illustration — it is a structural brand element.

🎯 OBJECTIVE

Integrate the face outline logo into the app so that it:

Reinforces brand identity

Feels calm and medical-adjacent

Never distracts from content

Adapts automatically to the app’s background color

Only the outline of the face should be used.
No fills, no background box, no gradients.

🧩 LOGO USAGE RULES (STRICT)

Use only the outline path of the face

Logo stroke color must:

Match the current page background color

Be rendered at low opacity (subtle, elegant)

Logo must never:

Overlap text

Reduce readability

Compete with primary UI elements

Think: quiet watermark, not decoration

📍 REQUIRED PLACEMENT LOCATIONS
1. Page Header (ALL SCREENS)

At the top of every screen:

Place the face outline logo:

Centered or subtly offset

Behind or above the page title

Opacity: very low (e.g. 4–8%)

Scale: large enough to be recognisable, never dominant

This must apply to:

Dashboard

AI Adviser screens

Scenario Adviser (including Travel Mode)

Supply Tracker

Settings

Emergency / Help Now screens

2. Navigation Tab Bar (MANDATORY)

In the bottom navigation bar:

Place a simplified version of the face outline:

Small

Clean

Stroke-only

Position:

Next to the app name “Diabeater”

Or as the primary brand icon in the navigation

Rules:

Must remain legible at small sizes

Must adapt to light/dark mode automatically

🎨 VISUAL STYLE REQUIREMENTS

Stroke weight:

Thin to medium

Consistent across all usages

Color logic:

Same hue as background

Slight contrast via opacity or blending

Background:

Transparent

Accessibility-safe (no visual noise)

🧱 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS

Logo must be:

Implemented as SVG or vector

Not rasterized

Scalable across devices

Centralize the logo component:

Single reusable component

Props for size, opacity, placement

Must support:

Light mode

Dark mode

Future themes

🧠 BRAND INTENT (DO NOT IGNORE)

The logo represents:

Duality

Reflection

Inner awareness

Calm vigilance

It should feel:

Thoughtful

Supportive

Non-clinical

Non-corporate

✅ ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

This task is complete only when:

The logo appears on every screen header

The logo appears in the navigation bar next to the app name

The logo adapts automatically to background color

The logo never interferes with content

The implementation is reusable and theme-aware

🚀 AFTER COMPLETION

Once implemented:

Confirm visual consistency

Validate accessibility

Prepare for brand system expansion
