Replit Agent Prompt: Enhance Supply Tracker (Prescription Memory, Pickup History, Settings Shortcut)
Context

You are working inside an existing diabetes app that includes a Supply Tracker feature.
Your task is to improve usability and continuity by remembering previously added prescriptions, tracking pickup history, and improving navigation to related settings.

Do not redesign the entire app.
Only modify and extend the Supply Tracker and its related data handling and navigation.

1. Remember Last Added Prescription (Reduce Repetitive Entry)
Problem

Users frequently add the same prescription repeatedly (e.g. insulin, sensors, strips).
Currently, they must re-enter the same information each time, which is unnecessary and error-prone.

Required Behavior

The app should remember the most recently added prescription and make it easy to reuse.

Functional Requirements

Store the last added prescription details, including:

Supply type (e.g. insulin, CGM, test strips)

Brand / name

Quantity

Units (e.g. pens, vials, sensors)

Typical refill amount (if applicable)

When the user opens Add Supply / Add Prescription:

Pre-fill the form with the last used prescription

OR present a clear option:

“Use last prescription”

“Add a different supply”

Allow users to:

Accept the pre-filled data with one tap

Edit any field before saving

UX Constraints

No extra steps during normal use

No modal overload

Default to speed and simplicity

2. Track Prescription Pickup Dates (Historical Memory)
Problem

Users need to know:

When they last picked up a prescription

How often refills occur

Patterns that affect supply planning

Required Behavior

The app should automatically remember pickup dates for each prescription.

Functional Requirements

Each time a prescription is logged as picked up:

Save the pickup date

Associate it with that specific prescription

For each prescription, store:

Last pickup date

Optional pickup history list (date + quantity)

Display on the Supply Tracker page:

“Last picked up: [date]”

Relative time when useful (e.g. “12 days ago”)

Use pickup dates to support future features (do not implement yet):

Refill reminders

Low-supply predictions

Data Constraints

Data should persist across sessions

Use the app’s existing storage approach (local storage, database, etc.)

Handle missing or legacy data gracefully

3. Add Navigation Shortcut to “Supply Usage Habits” (Settings)
Problem

Users frequently need to adjust Supply Usage Habits, but it is buried in Settings.

Required UI Change

On the Supply Tracker page, add a clear button or link that navigates directly to:

Settings → Supply Usage Habits

UI Requirements

Button text examples:

“Supply Usage Habits”

“Adjust Usage Settings”

Placement:

Visible but not intrusive

Near supply totals, estimates, or controls

Icon optional but recommended

Navigation Requirements

One-tap navigation

No confirmation dialogs

Preserve back navigation behavior

4. Non-Functional Requirements

Do not break existing supply data

Ensure backward compatibility with existing users

Keep logic modular (supply tracking vs settings)

Comment code clearly where state persistence is handled

5. Output Expectations

Update Supply Tracker UI to support pre-filled prescriptions

Implement persistence for:

Last added prescription

Prescription pickup dates

Add navigation control to Supply Usage Habits settings

Flag any assumptions or limitations clearly

Design Principle Reminder

This feature should feel like:

“The app remembers how I manage my supplies so I don’t have to.”

Speed, memory, and reduced cognitive load are the priority.
