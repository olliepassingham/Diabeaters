🩺 Replit Agent Project Prompt — Diabeaters
## 🧠 Project Overview
**Project Name:** Diabeaters  
**Goal:** A smart companion web app for **Type 1 diabetics**, designed to simplify daily management by tracking medical supplies and providing AI-based insulin and carbohydrate advice.  
**Core Modules:**  
1. Supply Management Tracker  
2. AI Activity Advisor  

---

## 🩹 Functional Overview

### 1. Supply Management Tracker
**Purpose:** Help users monitor prescription supplies and estimate how long they’ll last based on daily usage.

**User Inputs:**
- Daily usage rate for:
  - Short-acting insulin (units/day)
  - Long-acting insulin (units/day)
  - Needles (pieces/day)
  - CGM sensors (days per sensor)
- Current inventory for each item

**System Logic:**
- Calculates estimated days remaining
- Displays depletion forecast chart
- Triggers alerts when supplies < user-defined threshold
- Option to export data (CSV)
- Cloud sync of user profile and inventory data

**Expected Outputs:**
- Remaining supply estimates
- Reorder alert notifications
- Dashboard visualizations (bar charts, progress rings)

---

### 2. AI Activity Advisor
**Purpose:** Offer smart carbohydrate and insulin adjustment advice based on planned daily activity.

**User Inputs:**
- Mealtime carbohydrate ratio (g/unit)
- Activity type (e.g., walking, gym, sports)
- Activity duration and intensity
- Time of activity (before/after meal)

**AI Logic:**
- Uses OpenAI GPT-4o (via API) to generate advice:
  - Adjusted insulin ratio
  - Recommended carb portion (CP) before activity
  - Safety notes (risk of hypoglycemia)
- Option for chat-based Q&A interface

**Expected Outputs:**
- Text or card-based recommendation summary
- Optional daily advisory report
