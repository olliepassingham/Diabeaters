Replit Agent Prompt: Add Community Feature (Anonymous Questions, Topics, Shared Experiences)
Context

You are working inside an existing diabetes app.
Your task is to add a Community feature that allows users to ask questions, share experiences, and discuss challenges related to living with diabetes.

This feature should feel:

Supportive

Low-pressure

Encouraging

Safe for both anonymous and named participation

This is a new feature, but should integrate naturally with the app’s tone and design.

1. Purpose of the Community Feature
Primary Goal

👉 Create a space where users feel safe and encouraged to discuss real-life challenges, tips, and experiences.

The community is meant to:

Reduce isolation

Share practical, lived experience

Encourage peer-to-peer support

Complement (not replace) medical advice

This is not a medical diagnosis or emergency feature.

2. Core Community Functionality
Posting Questions / Topics

Users should be able to:

Post a question or discussion topic

Choose to post:

Anonymously

With their name (if profile exists)

Posting should feel easy and low effort.

Question Structure

Each post should include:

Question title (short, clear)

Optional longer description

Selected topic (required)

Posting mode:

Anonymous

Named

Optional metadata:

Date/time

Number of replies (future-proofing)

3. Topics & Filtering (Very Important)
Topic System

Questions must be categorized by topics so users can browse what’s relevant to them.

Initial example topics:

🌴 Holidays & Travel

🤒 Feeling Unwell / Sick Days

🏃 Exercise & Activity

🍽 Food & Eating Out

🧠 Mental Health & Burnout

🧰 Tips & What Worked for Me

❓ General Questions

Topics should be:

Easy to extend later

Stored as structured data, not hard-coded text

Filtering & Browsing

On the Community page:

Allow users to:

Filter by topic

Browse “All”

Keep filtering simple:

Chips / buttons

Dropdown (mobile-friendly)

Design goal:

“Let me quickly find people talking about the same thing I’m dealing with.”

4. Replies & Discussion (Phase 1 – Simple)

For initial implementation:

Allow users to reply to questions

Replies can also be:

Anonymous

Named

Keep replies chronological

No reactions, likes, or voting (for now)

Focus on conversation, not engagement mechanics.

5. Safety, Tone & Guardrails
Content Guidelines

Friendly, supportive language

No shaming or judgment

No medical instructions presented as facts

Disclaimer (Subtle)

Somewhere in the Community section:

“Community posts are based on personal experience and are not medical advice.”

Do not show this during emergencies.

Reporting / Moderation (Lightweight)

For now:

Add a simple “Report” option on posts

No heavy moderation tools required in Phase 1

Flag content for future admin review

6. Initial Seed Content (Important for Adoption)

To avoid an empty community, pre-populate with a few starter questions, such as:

🌴 “What holiday destinations have you found easiest to manage diabetes in?”

🤒 “When you’re unwell, what’s helped you manage your blood sugars?”

🧰 “What’s one diabetes tip you wish you’d learned earlier?”

These should be:

Open-ended

Friendly

Non-technical

Encouraging replies

7. UX & Design Requirements

Calm, welcoming design

No social pressure (likes, follower counts, etc.)

Clear indication when a post is anonymous

Large, readable text

Mobile-first layout

Tone should feel like:

“A group of people who get it.”

8. Data & Technical Considerations

Persist posts and replies

Store anonymity as a flag, not separate content

Ensure anonymous posts cannot be reverse-identified

Use existing app authentication where available

Work offline gracefully where possible (read-only)

9. Non-Functional Requirements

Do not impact Help Now or emergency features

Keep community logic modular

Comment code clearly for future expansion

Avoid notification overload

10. Output Expectations

Create a new Community section/page

Implement posting, replying, and topic filtering

Seed with initial example questions

Ensure anonymity works correctly

Flag future enhancements clearly in comments

Design Principle Reminder

This feature exists to say:

“You’re not the only one dealing with this.”

Keep it human, supportive, and simple.
