🚀 MASTER REPLIT AGENT PROMPT
Project: Diabeater – Proactive Diabetes Management App
🔹 ROLE & GOAL

You are Replit Agent, acting as a senior full-stack architect + product engineer.

Your task is to design and build the initial production-ready foundation of a cross-platform mobile application called Diabeater.

Core mission:
Build a proactive diabetes management app that anticipates risk, reduces cognitive load, and prevents emergencies using AI-driven guidance — not a passive logging app.

⚠️ Critical Constraint:
This app does NOT provide medical advice.
All AI outputs must be non-prescriptive, safety-first, clearly labelled.

🔹 PROJECT OVERVIEW

App Name: Diabeater
Platforms: iOS & Android
Target Users:

Primary: Type 1 Diabetes

Secondary: Type 2 Diabetes

Gestational Diabetes

Positioning:

Breakfast

Lunch

Dinner

Snacks

Logic:

Detect inconsistent or high-risk ratios

Suggest safe review considerations

Never give direct dosing instructions

Basal Support:

Guided basal-test planning

Clear prep instructions

Pattern-based AI insights

Re-check reminders (e.g. “Review again in X days”)

C. Activity Adviser (Exercise Mode)

Setup:

Typical meal ratios

Usual exercise habits

Daily Use:

Input:

Exercise type

Duration

Intensity

Outputs:

Carb-intake considerations

Dose-adjustment context, not instructions

Hypoglycaemia prevention guidance

D. Scenario Adviser
1. Sick Day Mode

Inputs:

Illness type

Severity

Current BG

Outputs:

Insulin-related considerations

Hydration reminders

Ketone awareness guidance

Clear red-flag warnings

2. Travel Mode

Inputs:

Travel duration

Destination

Logic:

Estimate supply needs

Add failure buffers

Outputs:

Smart packing list

F. Help Now (Emergency Mode)

One-tap access.

Features:

Immediate hypo guidance

Clear step-by-step safety actions

Emergency-mode UI

Calm, directive, non-judgmental language

🔹 SETTINGS & PERSONALISATION

User can edit:

Personal info

Units & formatting

Carb ratios

Prescriptions

TDD & habits

Widget layout

Alert preferences

🔹 COMMUNITY MODULE (OPTIONAL)

Peer support

Non-medical discussion

Lived-experience tips

Moderation required

🔹 UX & DESIGN REQUIREMENTS

Calm, reassuring medical-adjacent tone

Zero judgement language

Accessibility-first

Fast emergency access

Persistent disclaimers wherever AI advice appears

🔹 BUSINESS MODEL

Freemium

Free:

Core tracking

Basic AI guidance

Premium:

Scenario Adviser

Advanced AI insights

Smart supply prediction

Travel & Sick-Day modes

🔹 DEVELOPMENT INSTRUCTIONS

First, propose a clear development plan:

File structure

Module boundaries

Data models

AI abstraction layer

Wait for confirmation.

Then proceed with step-by-step implementation:

Auth & onboarding

Core dashboard

Supply tracker

AI framework (rules + LLM ready)

Prioritise:

Safety

Clarity

Extensibility

🔹 FINAL POSITIONING REMINDER

Diabeater is proactive, not reactive.
It reduces mental load, anticipates risk, and helps users stay prepared — not just log numbers.
